- 💼 **Work**: "I sent 15 emails today" → Productivity insights  
- 🧘‍♀️ **Wellness**: "I meditated for 10 minutes" → Mindfulness celebration

### **Conversational Magic**
```
User: "I read for 25 minutes and sent 8 emails today"

AI: "Excellent! 📚 25 minutes of reading logged! Knowledge is power!
     Great communication! 📧 8 emails logged! 
     You're crushing your productivity goals!"
```

### **Intelligent Goal Setting**
```
User: "I want to read 10 hours this month"

AI: "Great goal! Should audiobooks count, or just physical/digital reading? 
     Also, what time of day works best for reading reminders?"

User: "Both types, and remind me at 8 PM"

AI: "Perfect! Goal set: 10 hours reading this month (all formats) 
     with 8 PM daily check-ins. Ready to build that knowledge! 📚"
```
